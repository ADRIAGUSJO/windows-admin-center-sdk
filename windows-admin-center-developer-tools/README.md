# Project Honolulu
Welcome to Project Honolulu!  Project Honolulu is an evolution of Windows Server in-box management tools; it’s a single pane of glass, consolidating all aspects of local and remote server management. As a locally deployed, browser-based management experience, an Internet connection and Azure aren’t required.  Project Honolulu supports scenarios where customers need full control of all aspects of their deployment, including private networks which aren’t Internet-connected.

## Project Honolulu Extensions
Project Honolulu comes with a diverse set of management tools built in, and it can be extended to even more management scenarios via extensions. Extensions are authored by both Microsoft and (in the future) third parties, and will be available to download from the Project Honolulu Extension Store. By authoring an extension with Project Honolulu’s SDK and submitting it to the Project Honolulu team for approval and display in the Project Honolulu Extension Store, customers will be able to download and install extensions into their locally deployed instances of Project Honolulu.

Project Honolulu contains three main extensibility points: **tools**, **solutions**, and **gateway API extensions**.  Building a [tool extension](docs/getting-started.md) allows you to plug your functionality into existing solutions.  Building a [solution extension](docs/solution-extension.md) allows you to customize the connection type and tool list.  Building a [gateway API extension](docs/gateway-extensions.md) allows you to build additional capability at the gateway, such as custom REST endpoints.
